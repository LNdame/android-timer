codecentric android timer
=========================

This Android app is a simple countdown timer. You can set the timer (hours, minutes & seconds) and kick it off. Once started the timer will count down. When the timer reaches zero, it will start beeping. That's it, mostly.

In detail, the app offers a few more features:

* Two different styles to set the timer:
    * simple text fields or
    * wheels (similar to slot machine reels, credit goes to the [android-wheel project](http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/))
* Two different visualizations for a running countdown:
    * display remaining time like a digital clock,
    * visualize remaining time versus total time as a pie chart or
    * combine both of the above
* Option to keep the display turned on during the whole countdown

Currently, this app is not available on Google's Play Store, but you can download the [latest version](https://github.com/downloads/codecentric/android-timer/android-timer.apk) of it from the [download section](https://github.com/codecentric/android-timer/downloads) section here at github.
