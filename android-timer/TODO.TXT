==RETEST==

* Make tap anywhere for ShowCountdown configurable, if enabled, hide button.
  Default is false.
* Display the word "PAUSED" when the countdown is paused.
* [BUG] When set timer method preference is changed from ShowCountdownAct (or
  probably also from ShowCountdownAct.) the new setting is not applied when
  going back to SetTimerAct.
* Additional button in wheel view to reset a time part to zero
* Alarm rings for 5 min max. Configurable.
* [Bug] Change values in SetTimerActivity 
  -> Go to Preferences
  -> Go back
  -> Edits are lost
* Configure multiple timers and save them
  - Long click for context menu in manage timers view:
    - Rename
    - Delete timer
  - Load timers
  - Save timers
  - Bug: Change timer -> Menu -> Save as Favorite: Timer is correctly saved but
    SetTimerActivtiy has old values when returning from SaveTimerView. 
  - BUG: Change timer -> Menu -> Favorites -> Return: SetTimerActivtiy has old values 
    when returning from SaveTimerView.
  - Create sample entries only once, save boolean flag to preferences and never
    do it again.
  - Inserting/updating multiple timers with same name.
  - !!!!
    Use de.codecentric.android.timer.persistence.Timer value object in all activities
    (at least SetTimerActivity)
    !!!!

==IN PROGRESS==


==TODO==

* Once a timer has been loaded from favorites, its db id is remembered forever.
  "Save as Favorite" will always use this db id and update/overwrite this very
  timer. We need some way to save it as a new timer OR update the existing timer. 
* TODO Create sample db entries only once, save boolean flag to preferences and never
    do it again.
* Migrate app to roboguice (dependency injection for Android) to increase
  testability. Robolectric claims to work nicely with roboguice.
  http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/
  http://pivotal.github.com/robolectric/roboguice.html
* Convert to Maven or Gradle project  

=== FEATURES NEEDED BEFORE PUBLISHING ON GOOGLE PLAY STORE ===

* Change configuration of time fields to use so that it is not possible to
  show hours and seconds but not minutes (which makes no sense). Use an option
  list with the following options:
  - minutes only
  - minutes and seconds
  - hours and minutes
  - hours, minutes and seconds
  - Days and hours
  - Days, hours and minutes
  - Days, hours, minutes and seconds
* Select alarm sound from:
  + Phone alarm tones and ringtones
  + Custom MP3 file
* License?

=== OTHER FEATURES (LATER) ===

* Unit Tests for AbstractSetTimerActivity/SetTimerXxxActivity
* Make supressLeadingZeroOnHighestNonNullTimePart for ShowCountdownActivity
  configurable.
* Optional notification while counting down (default = ?)
* Optional notification that an alarm has been stopped because max duration was reached (default = true) 

* User hints (things that may not be obvious) - how can we tell the user
  about these features? 
  + A toast when an activity is started (toasts can be disabled in options)
  + Fixed text area on top/bottom of each activity? (Also possible to disable)
  + ...   
  Suggestions:
  - User menu key -> Options to configure this app 
  - You can disable help messages in the Options menu
  - Tap anywhere in ShowCountDownActivity to pause/continue, not just on the
    button
  - Canceling a timer is effectively a reset
  - Double tap a wheel to reset it to zero

* Long tap a wheel to reset it to zero
* Nicer visualization for ShowAlarm activity (ringing bell or something similar)

* StartupActivity does not really need to connect to the service, does it?

* [BUG] When changing used time fields from set timer acitivity, the timer is resetted
  to the last timer that was actually started. It would be nicer to keep the current
  value (adapted to missing fields)

* Integration tests and/or UATs
  See http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/testing/testing_android.html
  - http://code.google.com/p/robotium/               - Black box testing framework
  - https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android (cucumber for Android, needs ruby)

* Configure warning sounds when x minutes/seconds are left

* ? Reset button: I don't think we need one - when returning to SetTimerActivity,
  the time the user entered is there implicitly

* Test all possible workflows in all three activities:
  - Home button, then start app again:
    + SetTimerActivity: Should keep configured time
    + ShowCountdownActivity: Countdown should have continued while app was in
      background
    + ShowAlarm: Should stop alarm, on restart it should return to
      SetTimerActivity
  - Back button, then start app again
    + SetTimerActivity: Should keep configured time
    + ShowCountdownActivity: Countdown should have stopped on back button, on
      restart it should return to SetTimerActivity
    + ShowAlarm: Should stop alarm, on restart it should return to
      SetTimerActivity
  - Rotate phone (calls onCreate(), that's why it is important to test it)
    + SetTimerActivity: Should keep configured time
    + ShowCountdownActivity: Countdown should continued 
    + ShowAlarm: Beeping should continue

* Third alternative for countdown visualization: something like an analog clock
  with three hands (hours, minutes, seconds), but only show hands that are
  used.

== RELEASE NOTES ==

= 2012-04-?? =
* [BUG] Button label Pause/Continue is set to "Pause" when device is rotated,
  even if state is PAUSED and label should be "Continue"
* [FEATURE] Persist last manually entered time for countdown in
  SetTimerActivity when starting countdown and read this on app startup
  and use it instead of default time 
* Set default time to 15 minutes
* codecentric branding! (Background image)
* [FEATURE] Nicer input to set time (like HTC timer input - slot machine reel):
* [FEATURE] Hide hour input fields by default
* [FEATURE] Configure, which time parts are shown/used (Enable/disable each of hour,
  minute, second)

= 2012-05-14 =
* [FEATURE] Hide unused ( = 00 ) TextViews in ShowCountdownActivity, when all
  fields of larger magnitude are also hidden/00.
* Wheels should run the other way round. Or make that configurable.
* Wheels should display numbers below ten with two digits/leading zero.
* Show countdown activity should not format numbers below ten with two digits/
  leading zeroes, when larger fields are hidden. 
* !!! Service should start alarm sound, SoundGizmo should be a collaborator of service,
  not of ShowAlarmActivity !!
* Refactor navigation/onAfterServiceConnected:
  Subclasses tell superclass which states they handle themselves and which not
  For not-handled states, navigation occurs. For handled states, control is delegated
  to subclass.
* Put a persisten notification in the notificationbar when alarm is ringing. This links to
our app/ShowAlarmActivity. It will be removed when alarm is stopped.
* Introduce new StartupActivity
* [FEATURE] Configure, which activity is used to set the timer, SetTimerTextFields
  or SetTimerWheels - and save value to preferences. 
  - Use StartupActivity to delegate to the correct SetTimer activity subclass
* New app icon with branding
* Pause countdown by tapping anywhere (except cancel button), resume on second tap 
* Configure wheel direction
* Change set timer method without restart 
* option to keep the display on - prevent auto display off
* Add pie chart to ShowCountdown 
* Show fraction of remaining time as pie chart
* Make ShowCountdown view configurable: Pie Chart & Time, Pie Chart only, Time only
* Delay start alarm for CountdownService#UPDATE_INTERVALL to give
  ShowCountdownActivity a chance to show zero (0 and empty pie chart)?
* Touch anywhere also for ShowAlarm? Or make "Stop Alarm" button BIG!
